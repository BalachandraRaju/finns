## 🎓 **Scanner Details**

### Scanner #17: 52-Week High Breakout

**Logic:**
1. Current high >= 52-week high (250 trading days from MongoDB)
2. Volume >= 1.5x daily average (confirmation)

**Use Case:**
- Catch major breakouts at all-time highs
- Strong momentum trades
- Rare but powerful signals

**Example:**
```
SBIN on Oct 17, 2025:
- 52-week high: ₹891.85
- Current high: ₹894.75
- Breakout: +₹2.90 (+0.33%)
- Volume: 1.58x average
- Status: ✅ TRIGGERED
```

---

### Scanner #20: Bullish for Tomorrow

**Logic:**
1. MACD histogram V-shape recovery
2. MACD-Signal difference increasing >= 0.2
3. MACD line > Signal line (bullish crossover)

**Use Case:**
- Identify bullish momentum reversals
- MACD-based divergence plays
- Next-day swing trades

**Status:** ⚠️ Needs optimization (threshold too strict for intraday)

---

### Scanner #23: Breaking Out Now

**Logic:**
1. Current candle body >= 3x average of last 10 candles
2. Bollinger Bands expansion
3. Green candle (bullish)

**Use Case:**
- Catch stocks breaking out RIGHT NOW
- Strong momentum candles
- Scalping and quick trades

**Example:**
```
ASTRAL on Oct 17, 2025:
- Candle height: ₹1.30
- Average height: ₹0.15
- Ratio: 8.67x
- BB: Expanding
- Status: ✅ TRIGGERED
```

---

### Scanner #32: Intraday Breakout Setup

**Logic:**
1. Price breaking above/below opening range (first 15 minutes)
2. Volume >= 2x daily average per minute
3. RSI > 55 (breakout) or < 45 (breakdown)

**Use Case:**
- Opening range breakout trades
- First 30 minutes momentum
- High-probability intraday setups

**Status:** ⚠️ Needs optimization (RSI threshold too strict)

---

## 🔍 **Optimization Recommendations**

### Scanner #20 (Bullish for Tomorrow)
- **Current:** MACD-Signal diff >= 0.4
- **Recommended:** Relax to >= 0.2 for intraday
- **Reason:** Intraday MACD moves are smaller than daily

### Scanner #32 (Intraday Breakout Setup)
- **Current:** RSI > 60 (bullish) or < 40 (bearish)
- **Recommended:** Relax to > 55 or < 45
- **Reason:** More alerts without sacrificing quality
